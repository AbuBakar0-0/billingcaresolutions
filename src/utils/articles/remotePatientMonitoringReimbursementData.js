            <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
                <li><strong>Patient Consent:</strong> Providers must obtain and document the patient’s consent before RPM services can be provided.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Specifications:</strong> The device used must automatically collect and transmit health data, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, or heart rate, without manual intervention from the patient.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Necessity:</strong> RPM must be medically necessary and prescribed by a qualified healthcare provider for patients with chronic conditions or those requiring continuous monitoring.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="benefits-rpm" class="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary">Benefits of RPM for Providers and Patients</h2>
